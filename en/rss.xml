I just finished building my first prototype winform application made in Visual Studio. I spent about 2 years working in Unity, but I had never used Visual Studio before and decided to make a Music App. I didn&amp;amp;#39;t like the basic Groove Music app on my computer, so I decided to try and build something that would serve my own use case better. Behold, New Wave Music Player.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The idea behind my application is to be able to access any of my files as quickly as possible, and to play them. I don&amp;amp;#39;t like having to wait for a music player to build a library before I can listen to music.  This is designed to compile a list of all the music within a selected directory, with the ability to play any of them simply by clicking on them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also wrote the ability to search youtube for a link, and play the video in the app. That way, if I don&amp;amp;#39;t have the music on my computer, I can simply put the link into the box, and listen to it in the same app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/oqjsrsh8qeq81.png?width=934&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=e6cc547e3a718d4998831eb728efc86af68400cf&quot;&amp;gt;User Interface of New Wave Music Player&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here is the link to the GitHub where the application can be downloaded:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

That way is certainly convenient, since an app developer needs only to parse the DB connection URL from the corresponding config variable (i.e. environment variable) in application code to connect to the DB. But leaving DB servers exposed to the whole world seems a clear violation of security best practices.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Heroku has its own solution to this problem: Private Spaces. In a private space, your app&amp;amp;#39;s dynos and certain qualifying add-ons are hosted together within a virtual private cloud (VPC) that is firewalled off from the rest of the internet. It comes with a couple important caveats, however: you have to have a Heroku Enterprise account (which is rather expensive and requires you to give up the option to use cheaper dyno types) and it only supports a handful of select add-ons (specifically Heroku&amp;amp;#39;s first party add-ons right now) to be sequestered with the app in its VPC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My new add-on service (Borealis Isolated Postgres: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.borealis-data.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.borealis-data.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) aims to provide an alternative that sits somewhere between the extreme simplicity and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;relative&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; inexpensiveness of DB add-ons available on the Common Runtime and the considerably more expensive Private Spaces while offering a similar level of security as Private Spaces. The add-on is in beta now at no cost: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://elements.heroku.com/addons/borealis-pg&quot;&amp;gt;https://elements.heroku.com/addons/borealis-pg&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With my add-on, each DB server is in a PostgreSQL-compatible Amazon Aurora DB cluster isolated within its own VPC. All connections to a DB server are required to be forwarded through an SSH server that is dedicated to that VPC.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So how does an app connect? I wrote a Heroku buildpack to take care of that seamlessly (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OldSneerJaw/heroku-buildpack-borealis-pg-ssh&quot;&amp;gt;https://github.com/OldSneerJaw/heroku-buildpack-borealis-pg-ssh&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;). When associated with an app, the buildpack automatically identifies any config variables from my add-on and sets up a persistent SSH local port forwarding connection to the database server using autossh. The app can then connect to the database via any PostgreSQL-compatible client library using the add-on&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;DATABASE_URL&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; config variable without having to be aware of the SSH connection. In other words, application code doesn&amp;amp;#39;t have to change at all to support it. If an app works with the first-party Heroku Postgres add-on, it should work with my add-on, too.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Connecting from your local machine or a CI server to a database server is also straightforward. I wrote a Heroku CLI plugin (&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/borealis-pg-cli&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.npmjs.com/package/borealis-pg-cli&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;) that includes a couple simple commands to either run DB scripts (e.g. DB migrations to be executed during CI/CD) or open a persistent tunnel locally (e.g. for ad hoc data administration). It also has a few commands for managing which PostgreSQL extensions/modules are installed, since the app user does not have privileges to do so in SQL.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During the beta all add-ons are provisioned in a multi-tenant environment to keep my costs down, but when released to general availability, each premium add-on will get its own fully isolated VPC that is only accessible via its private SSH server. I have not yet decided whether I will continue to provide a free, multi-tenant option after GA, though.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;#39;re already a Heroku user, you can provision the add-on directly (for free) here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://dashboard.heroku.com/provision-addon?addonServiceId=de00ba11-8b65-47cd-b099-9605703a6e30&quot;&amp;gt;https://dashboard.heroku.com/provision-addon?addonServiceId=de00ba11-8b65-47cd-b099-9605703a6e30&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Documentation is here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/borealis-pg#getting-started&quot;&amp;gt;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/borealis-pg#getting-started&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;HOW&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;: Trellis allows you to create custom audible workout routines. A single click starts a workout, announcing your goals, start and rest times. This then repeats automatically until you have finished every set of the workout.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyone who has tried the popular follow-along equipment/routines will agree, they are intense and distraction free. Their only problem is that it is nearly impossible to find one that perfectly fits you. That is why Trellis is a tool not a prescription, allowing you to fully customize a routine to your needs and abilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Adding new features every week based on your feedback, so please reach out!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

You know... to know how the successful guys cracked the code, created amazing things, and achieved some lvl of success.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today I wanted to share a few of these. I also wrote more in-depth articles, with more strategies and psychology explained behind them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;OnlyFans&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Make use of your previous experience&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Timothy Stokely, the founder, previously had similar startups, like GlamGirls, GlamWorship, and Customs4U.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They were basically porn sites. They gave Stokely an experience (and networks) in the world of content for adults. The first creators on OnlyFans.com came from that source. Stokely reached out to porn influencers and encouraged them to move to OnlyFans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Twitter integration from day 1&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OnlyFans accounts had automatic Twitter integration. Creators could share their referral links easily on Twitter. Their fans could see it immediately. It worked seamlessly since day 1 of OnlyFans and generated a great boost to the traffic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Loose censorship&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;OnlyFans got so popular thanks to its loose censorship policy. Porn stars were able to share their content that would get quickly banned in most of the other places.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-onlyfans-grew-to-over-100-million-users/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Canva&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;MVP&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Melanie Perkins was teaching students about design. She noticed that students had a huge need for a simple graphic design tool. She wanted to make it easier to create visuals.  Photoshop was too intimidating for most users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So she created &amp;amp;quot;Fusion Books&amp;amp;quot; which would enable schools to design and create high-quality yearbooks for students.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perkins and Obrecht made some cold calls to schools to pitch the idea of Fusion Books. Obrecht modulated his voice when the schools wanted to speak with the project manager. They have reached 400 schools. They even sent some free samples of the designs and it worked.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Spreading the word through conferences and people&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To promote Canva, Perkins kept going to as many conferences and meet-ups as possible. She attended conferences for bloggers, designers, and social media marketers. She pitched Canva to the attendees.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perkins and Obrecht reached out to popular designers and graphic design influencers. They asked them to talk about Canva and recommend it to their followers and fans.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Building a waitlist with the help of a high-profile tech influencer&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Perkins and Obrecht built a community around Canva and created a waitlist. It was all before Canva even started.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;50,000 users have signed up on their waitlist before Canva&amp;amp;#39;s public launch. It got to 150,000 pretty fast thanks to a tech influencer, Guy Kawasaki. One of Kawasaki’s employees was using Canva and made him get interested in the app.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-canva-grew-to-1-million-users-in-2-years-canva-marketing-strategies/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Reddit&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Faking traffic&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Reddit founders had a “chicken &amp;amp;amp; egg” problem. No users to create a content = no users to see the content.The founders created several fake accounts and started posting various links. They kept doing this for months until they got some real traction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the first real users started joining Reddit, fake accounts started to disappear. People reported their “odd activity” and the fake accounts got phased out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Making it look bigger&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the beginning, Reddit’s creators put all users in one place to create a “feeling” that the platform is “crowded”. One group with 100 users looks much better than a group with 10 people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Users generated content&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;3 years after the launch, Reddit users could submit their own subreddits. This feature gave steady growth at the beginning&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-reddit-started-and-grew-to-250m-monthly-pageviews-within-5-years/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Pinterest&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Word of mouth and first users&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The first Pinterest users were from the creator’s hometown, Des Moines. Ben, the founder was organizing meet-ups at local boutiques and handed out invites to the attendees. The word spread further within smaller groups and clubs. The First 3,000 users appeared within 3 months. Most of these people were involved in some DIY and handicraft stuff.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Invite-only &amp;amp;amp;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;„Pin it forward” campaign&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The first 2 years Pinterest was an invite-only platform.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Ben has partnered with SF Girl by Bay, an SF-based blogger, to create an inspirational pinboard on „what home means to you”.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Then, other bloggers, mostly publishing about DIY or handicraft, were invited to the platform and to participate in the campaign, sharing their take on the subjects through sharing their pinboard with their readers. And those bloggers had invites to give away.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;That campaign gathered 300 bloggers and 10 of them published each week on a topic and linked back to pinboard.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;That was simply marketing Pinterest through community leaders.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-did-pinterest-start-and-grew-to-40-million-valuation-in-the-first-year/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Slack&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Word of mouth with Twitter&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Slack’s founder, Stewart Butterfield, also created Flickr. He was widely known by various communities. His Twitter accounts had thousands of followers. He tweeted a lot about Slack. The word spread pretty fast among people. 8,000 users signed up on Slack&amp;amp;#39;s day one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Focusing on good PR&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Butterfield reached out directly to the journalists. His team informed them about a new project “from the author of Flickr.” It gave Slack a boost - about 20% of Slack’s user growth was because of media.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-slack-got-from-0-to-1-12-b-and-285k-users-in-the-first-year-marketing-strategies-and-psychology/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;HEY (email)&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Personal brand and Twitter&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Before HEY email Jason Fried and David Heinemeier, founded the Basecamp. They both had hundreds of thousands of followers on their Twitter accounts.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;They tweeted about the app before they launched it, and kept gradually letting people onto their waitlist.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Waitlist&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fried and David used it to pump up the hype around Hey email. One week after the app&amp;amp;#39;s launch, they already got more than 100,000 people.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-hey-email-got-100k-users-in-the-first-week/&quot;&amp;gt;Link to the article with more details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;WhatsApp&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;First users among friends&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Jan Koum, WhatsApp’s founder, attended weekly meetings at his friend’s place. There were a lot of local Russians, and Koum pitched WhatsApp to them. It gave him the first dozens of users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abusing App Store loopholes&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;App Store didn&amp;amp;#39;t have many apps at that time. Koum discovered that the “What&amp;amp;#39;s New” section could be easily abused.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By constantly changing the name of WhatsApp on App Store it kept the app at the top of the App Store&amp;amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;What&amp;amp;#39;s New&amp;amp;quot; list. This little cheat made WhatsApp stay there for as long as the loop didn’t get fixed by Apple. It was enough to collect the first 1,000 users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Snapchat&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Pitching the app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, the founders of Snapchat, pitched their app (called then “Picaboo”) in their community:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they handed out flyers,&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they were giving tutorials,&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;they were talking to people 1-on-1 about the app,&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;and even reached out to some journalists.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It didn’t get them much popularity, though. They got only 127 users, and all of them were their friends.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Available for iPads&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Snapchat started to grow when Spiegel and Murphy made it available for iPads. The target audience was teenagers and students. But, not many of them had iPhones at that time. iPads were more common.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Murphy took a job as a coder in a company selling iPads and learned their system. So, he thought Snapchat should be available not only for iPhones but also for iPads. That slowly took the user count to 1,000.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Tapping into high schoolers&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Snapchat got 127 users in the first 6 months - mostly founders&amp;amp;#39; friends&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;When after 6 months one of the founders’ mother told their teenage cousin about the snapchat, the app went instantly viral at a local high school in Southern California, and beyond.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;It gave teenagers an opportunity to exchange messages quickly and left no evidence.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The app grew from 127 to 30k in 2 months&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thant&amp;amp;#39;s all, thanks&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Back in March last year, I was hating my job. I was overworked, frequently ignored (even though I was the CTO) and undermined daily by a boss who knew better about everything. Due to the constant undermining, I had lost all confidence in myself and my ability as a professional. My brain told me that this job was as good as it was gonna get because nobody else would hire me. Anyone who has felt this way before knows how dark these times can be. They are all-consuming and make you question your entire existence.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Luckily, I had great people around me. I had my wife building me up daily. She created a jar of positive affirmations which is a mechanism for anyone who struggles with depression. I had also started with a great therapist who put me on anti-depressants. I was heading out of the dark into the light, but I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t quite there, yet.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;The Workout Montage&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was feeling mentally better than I did. But I needed something that would give me purpose, that was fun and that would give me the confidence to do what I really needed to do... get the fuck out of my job.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It had been over a year since I had worked on any side projects, I needed something new. Something that may actually help me better organise my day, as being overwhelmed was maybe something at this point I could fix.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I had been trying to find a tool that would integrate with everything I used daily. I was spread across multiple different Jira boards. I had items personal notes in the mac notes app. I had personal to-do&amp;amp;#39;s in the Microsoft To-Do app and then I had my meetings. That was 4 separate apps, and I was always several clicks away from anything I needed. That&amp;amp;#39;s not great at the best of times, but when you suffer from ADHD the distraction opportunities between 4 clicks are high! Nothing was working, and it was chaos.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So, I started hacking together a MacOS app that would be accessible on my mac from any screen, via the menu bar or a keyboard shortcut. It would be integrated with Jira so I could add my tasks from multiple boards/projects in one place along with my calendar via the use of the Apple Calendar API. &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;And it worked!&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;...Well, in theory, it did. I wasn&amp;amp;#39;t actually any more organised as I was now distracted by improving my app, which would eventually be known as &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://sprintdock.app&quot;&amp;gt;SprintDock&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Recap in a Recap. Recap-ception.&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I had found a problem, a problem that I knew other people would, and I was already well on my way to having a solution. That was an assumption at this point, but one that proved to be right further down the line. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But equally as important, I had got my confidence and mojo back! I could tell myself again with confidence I was good at this shit, and this job that was killing me was not &amp;amp;#39;as good as it was gonna&amp;amp;#39; get&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am sharing this extremely personal journey, as a reminder to myself and anyone else who is or has been in a similar boat, that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;you are not your job&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;. But also how passion project, good people, and drive is all it really takes to change your path in life. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Side projects changed my life.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One that convinced me the most was, ProductHunt&amp;amp;#39;s open call and endorsement for hate and discrimination against Russian civilians. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Earlier in March, they released a notorious newsletter which featured a product that shared a list of media outlets that are true source for Russia-Ukraine conflict. When I fact-checked, I found those sites were funded by controversial billionaire &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/qQbVyHVmmKs&quot;&amp;gt;George Soros&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (world&amp;amp;#39;s biggest propaganda financier). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Upon further investigation, I was shocked to find, some past investors of PH are closely linked to George Soror&amp;amp;#39;s Open Society Foundation. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The propaganda and hate doesn&amp;amp;#39;t end here, PH went overboard with endorsing a product that cuts Russia out from sites: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/redirect-russia&quot;&amp;gt;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/redirect-russia&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (in-spite of backlash in the comments and poor ratings, PH employees not only upvoted this product, but shared it on their social handles plus let it become a #3 top product of the day + newsletter placement). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best comment on the hate-mongering product was from a London-based gentleman:   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/fm4scrlfnkp81.png?width=714&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2743301e58a7edc7cfdc05e348392f07cf2868e2&quot;&amp;gt;London&amp;amp;#39;s citizen raising concern over &amp;amp;#39;PH enabling hate on Russian civilians&amp;amp;#39;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#x200B;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://preview.redd.it/rqz3g0ojnkp81.png?width=725&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=4a8e5c70eb0a156f82eee613e23d603388cf4b4c&quot;&amp;gt;Blocking Russia from the world strengthens Putin, says Cuba-based entrepreneur&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If ProductHunt continues to allow hate for Russian civilians, it will spiral into questioning US for Iraq, Afganistan, Syria, etc. Nations like UAE, India, Russia and non-NATO countries contribute to more than 50% of the  Product Hunt traffic. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;PH should absolutely campaign to support Ukraine, but should refrain for calling for hate on Russian civilians. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Unless PH has sold itself to George Soros&amp;amp;#39; investors, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;I personally feel ProductHunt should limit it&amp;amp;#39;s political expression and keep the platform inclusive, safe and hate-free.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Maybe political products should be fact-checked. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We are already over-exposed to political news on social media, business communities like Product Hunt must stop politicizing their platform. Do you agree? What do you think? Let me know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We built a slack app to solve a simple problem: Managing capacity in a hybrid office.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We figured companies would downsize their office space and most would have less desks available than number of people in the team. So managing capacity in a hybrid-work setting would become an issue, primarily for office managers. Managing this with spreadsheets, forms, emails etc would be inefficient.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We also thought that for small companies this problem will exist, but will not be big enough to start using / paying for a dedicated piece of software. So we thought Slack would be the best place to solve this.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We built something really simple. An office user can&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- Book a day in the office,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- See who will be in the office,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- Cancel a booking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;An office manager can&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- create a space (a space for an office, or multiple spaces if they want to breakdown the office),&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- set a capacity per space,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
- see some analytics and so on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Take a look here: &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://bukadesk.com/&quot;&amp;gt;https://bukadesk.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you would be willing to offer some guidance;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Does the problem resonate with you? Have you been in a situation where you need to book a space to go to the office?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Any input / feedback you could offer to improve the service?&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there, &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Few weeks back I was brainstorming a new project idea. Doing so I started searching for the domain name for the project. After few suggestions I started looking for the social media availability as well.   &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Same domain and same username is a branded way to built a successful startup. In that mind I started thinking why not create a service for searching both in the same place.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Right now I&amp;amp;#39;ve added few extension and social media searches only. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;amp;#39;re welcome to search domain name in social domain website. And, please share your thoughts to improve the service is welcome.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;last year I spent $280k and bought a SaaS company of MicroAcquire. To some people that sounds like a LOT, to others it sounds like nothing. To me, it was HELLA expensive and scary as 💩.  If you are interested how it went down I wrote about it &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Spencer.Scott/spending-280k-on-microacquire-58e483b37ef4&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Anyways, in order to kick start our marketing efforts we decided to look into AppSumo. After about 6 months of back and forth we decided to move forward with an AppSumo promotion 😬. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On March 17th we went live with AppSumo. You can check out the deal &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://appsumo.com/products/median/&quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; if you are interested.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you don&amp;amp;#39;t know what AppSumo is, it&amp;amp;#39;s basically Groupon for SaaS companies. They negotiate insane pricing then blast that pricing out to 500k to 1 million email subscribers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My idea behind the promotion was to put some money back in our pockets so we no longer have to bleed money into development. Its also a nice kicker that AppSumo will introduce Median to 500k to 1 million people.  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The team at AppSumo predicted that we would do about $200k in revenue from this promotion of which we get to keep 25% 😬. I have to be honest with yah, we are no where near being on pace to do $200k. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time of me writing this we have had 194 new companies sign up since going live (6 days). I dont know how these promotions typically go but so far the feedback has been great. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are interested, I will continue to update this post as the deal progresses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Cheers 🍻 Spencer&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Resumemaker.online recently reached a huge milestone: 1.000.000 free downloads. Almost at the same time, it also hit 100.000 thousands unique visitors per month for the first time. I thought it could be a good idea to write a simple recap and look back on how it grew this much without me spending any considerable time for marketing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Disclaimer: this is by no means a guide or advice on what to do, because I’m far from being a good marketer (more often than not I feel like I’m throwing darts in the dark), but by telling my story, hopefully it sparks ideas that are applicable to your businesses.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During these past 3,5 years since I launched ResumeMaker.Online, I moved to three different countries and worked at three different full time jobs.Adapting to new cultures, settle down and finding where to live, visa paperwork, learning the ins and outs of new organizations: there were always too many things going on at the same time to set proper routines around a side project, plus I didn’t want to neglect my main source of income nor my relationships. It was not uncommon to spend entire weeks without being able to work on my side project for more than an hour or two.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Eventually, I managed to consistently work from about 4 to 6 hours during the weekends. Not ideal but, at least, it narrowed down the scope. This made it clear that the marketing strategy needed to be one that wouldn’t require constant action from my part. Instead, it should focus on bringing practical long-lasting, continued results. Here it is what worked:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;SEO&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Almost 65% of the traffic comes from organic search. I had a head start by being selected &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/resumemaker-online&quot;&amp;gt;#1 Product of the day + week&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on Product Hunt. This built a good reputation and snowballed into countless backlinks, tweets and shares from day one.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was a total beginner and not part of the indie hackers scene at all. I posted it just for fun, with zero real expectations. Looking back, knowing now how much of an impact it can have, I would have taken more time to prepare for the launch to leave less room for luck to play a major role.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From there on, it was relatively easy to follow up to the successful launch. I wrote an UX case study, did multiple interviews and got featured on several indie hacker/Saas related websites and design blogs, although it was always a struggle to get noticed outside the tech, design and indie hacker bubble.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My target audience are not tech savvy users and the goal was to get press coverage on more main stream channels. I wrote a cold mail template with a media kit attached that I sent to hundreds of journalists with pretty low success. I realized then, that it was not time effective to peruse both small, medium and big publications. So, I made the bold assumption that once a big online newspaper writes about my product, then the smaller ones would echo the story.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At first, I was not getting any replies and getting really frustrated seeing how the little time I had was going to waste, so I decided to change the angle of the story. Instead of making it about the product, I made it about my personal journey.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During that time, Argentina (my home country) was suffering harshly the economic effects of the pandemic and it was under one of the most strict set of restrictions in the world. The story about an Argentinian that fled the country, landed a job overseas, and was helping others do the same was much more interesting to a mainstream audience than just talking about a website. And it worked! &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clarin.com/viste/joven-creo-pagina-web-diseno-cv-gratis-descargaron-800-mil-curriculums_0_k45nwO3Fv.html&quot;&amp;gt;I managed to get an interview with Clarín&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, one of the most popular news sites in South America with more than 20 millions (!) unique visitors per month. As an extra, my assumption was correct and a lot of other news websites did echo the story, resulting in even more back links without me having to move a finger.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I’ll try to be alert to any new window of opportunity to pitch journalists with the right angle and multiply the result of the efforts, rather than merely talk about the product itself and getting low return of the time investment.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Getting high quality back links was only one part, the other was making sure the website meets the Google SEO requirements with flying colors. At one point, I got really comfortable with the rankings. ResumeMaker.Online was on the first page of Google for keywords like “resume maker” in almost every country, thanks to the number of backlinks. Then, ​from one day to another, the December 2020 Google Core Update tanked the rankings hard.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I was in shock, thinking the site was never going to recover. In a way, I’m glad it happened. It was a much-needed wake-up call to take ResumeMaker.Online to the next level and tick all the boxes in Google Search Console.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Back in early-mid 2021, I took a two week vacation at my full time job. I just chilled and recharged during the first week and, after that, I worked non stop on fixing all the problems that Google listed and revamped the mobile experience from scratch. Nowadays, ResumeMaker.Online v2.0 ranks better than ever and the improved performance (perfect score in Google Insights) have had an impact, not only on the rankings, but on the overall user experience and sales as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Multilingual support&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I introduced support for six more languages: Spanish, German, Portuguese, Swedish, French and Italian. Data shows that despite most of the traffic is in English, up to 10% of users land in non-english pages.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Watermark link&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During its first years, I was concerned that monetizing the product could get in the way of growth. Instead, I offered a 100% free service but I added a watermark link at the end of the page. By nature, a CV is shared with multiple other people and I wanted to leverage on that. Currently, almost 2% of the traffics comes from users that click in a watermark that took me less than 10 minutes to add.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Share to download&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When I introduced the paid PRO version (without watermark), the free download remained available, but this time, locked behind a share-to-unlock feature. Now, users need to share a link on one of the available social media channels in order to unlock the download link, a fair deal in my opinion.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Currently, more than 25.000 free resumes are downloaded monthly. Even though many users do probably delete their post just after sharing, around 10% of the traffic comes from social media every month. This is a huge increase compared to previous performance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Sharable discount link&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;After payment, users can also spread the word by sharing a discount link for the PRO download with friends and family. The traffic from this source is below 1%. Naturally, it is too low compared to the result of other efforts, but almost 70% of paid users copy the link and the conversion rate is almost double.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Preparing for the future&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was important to have realistic expectations on what I could accomplish with limited time, although there was no reason not to get ready for what’s to come. I have plans to launch a remote jobs newsletter some time during this year, so I added a newsletter subscription form. It currently sits at 30.000 subscribers averaging +800 new subs per week. When time is right to start working on this, subscribers are already there!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;--&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The dream is to come to a full circle and end up in a situation where most things are automated and no active marketing is required from my part, besides two or three hours of work per week, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;but&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; with much bigger revenue than now. So, in the meantime, there’s plenty more work to do!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also promote this project in the same way. For example, I monitor the keyword &amp;amp;quot;How to find beta users&amp;amp;quot; and then, based on the results, I leave a response with an offer to try my product to get beta testers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a good way to promote your product, as you are solving a person&amp;amp;#39;s pain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The project is still far from perfect, there is work to be done, but the basic functionality is already there and it works.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the time there wasn&amp;amp;#39;t anything out there I could find to accomplish this so decided to write my own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jbh-cloud/spotify_sync&quot;&amp;gt;spotify_sync&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is written in Python and runs as one-shot application meaning it can easily be scheduled with cron. The script caches a copy of all Spotify song metadata, then attempts to match these songs to a Deezer equivalent. Once the batch of songs has been matched it will attempt to download them from Deezer utilising &amp;lt;a href=&quot;https://git.freezerapp.xyz/RemixDev/deemix-py&quot;&amp;gt;deemix-py&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can download up to 320kbps with a free Deezer account, however a Premium account is required to download lossless. I rotate Deezer Premium account free trials burner email and card details.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my first major open-source project so welcome all feedback.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
