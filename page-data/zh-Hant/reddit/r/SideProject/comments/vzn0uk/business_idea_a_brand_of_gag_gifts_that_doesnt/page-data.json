Every week I post a few business ideas on here for you all to chat about. If you’d like to see our archive of past ideas at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hate gag gifts. But not because I don’t like the idea of them. I hate them because they always boil down to “Oh wow, you got me garbage! Ha ha how funny.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All gag gifts that I’ve ever seen were both:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not good as pranks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Not good as gifts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The “gag” of the gift is almost always just that the recipient expected a gift and got trash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Idea&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is super simple: A site / brand that sells gag gifts that are both:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderately functional / useful&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Actually funny&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you accomplish that. It’s a super simple formula.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You sell normal commodity products that everyone uses. Trash cans, toasters, speakers, coffee makers, etc. Things that the person could actually use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, you create some mechanic inside of these products that slowly and subtly (over months of use) changes their behavior to make the people feel like they’re going crazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You buy someone a gag trash can. At the start it’s totally normal. Maybe the hinge squeaks a little bit. Slowly, over 1-2 months, the squeak gets fairly loud. By month 3 the trash can is fully moaning every time someone opens / closes it. Go to your friend’s house and watch their descent into madness as their trash can screams at the top of its lungs every time it opens. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You buy them a toaster. Over the first 1-2 months, it seems normal. There’s a bit of a weird toasting pattern on one side but whatever. After 2-3 months, someone in their family notices that the pattern looks kind of like Jesus. Maybe they contact the news or try to sell it for $1000 on Facebook marketplace. Then by month 6 it is a totally clear picture of Jesus on their toast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You get them a nice bluetooth speaker. Every week it increases the pitch of the song by just a hair. By the 3 month mark everything they listen to sounds like Alvin and the Chipmunks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s the idea. Just gifts that are normal and somewhat useful, but subtly drives the person crazy over time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? Would you buy something like that for your friends?
