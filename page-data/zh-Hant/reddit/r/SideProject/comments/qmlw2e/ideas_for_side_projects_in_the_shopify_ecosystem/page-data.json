Shopify communities are on the rise, e.g. the Shopify subreddit grew at a rate of <a href=\"https://frontpagemetrics.com/r/shopify\">&gt;50%</a> over the last 12 months.

So let&#39;s dive right in and explore some problems you could solve for Shopify entrepreneurs.</p>\n\n<h1>👩‍💼 Hiring Great Shopify Experts</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Shopify entrepreneurs are looking to hire great Shopify experts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Unbundle Fiverr &amp; Upwork: Build a curated platform for Shopify entrepreneurs &amp; experts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attractiveness</strong>: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 There are tons of Shopify entrepreneurs looking for experts. We think there&#39;s a great opportunity in the unbundling of large freelancer platforms like Fiverr &amp; Upwork. The big value those platforms provide is optionality: you&#39;ll find thousands of freelancers to hire. But nowadays, optionality and quantity aren&#39;t the best value-adds anymore. Nowadays, people want curation. I don&#39;t need 100 people applying for a freelance gig. What I really need is 2-3 GREAT people to choose from. That&#39;s where we see tons of opportunities: build niche, curated freelancer platforms, in this case for Shopify entrepreneurs &amp; experts.</p>\n\n<h1>📈 Helping Shopify Entrepreneurs Succeed</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Many Shopify entrepreneurs didn&#39;t achieve their desired success, yet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Mastermind groups with educational content, accountability groups, and events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attractiveness</strong>: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 One of our observations on Reddit in general, and the Shopify subreddit in specific, is that the most upvoted posts are often success stories. What does this tell us? Success stories show community members that achieving their goals is possible. The prospect of making a lot of money as a business owner operating independently seems to be an idea that resonates strongly with a lot of people. Helping them achieve this goal is, therefore, a great business opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>In the Shopify subreddit, a Redditor offered to host a mastermind group for Shopify entrepreneurs making &gt;6-figures. This post was very popular, but the group is only accessible to those who are already successful. We think that there is an opportunity here: hosting mastermind groups for aspiring entrepreneurs with educational content, accountability groups, and events.</p>\n\n<h1>💸 Selling Digital Products on Shopify</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Selling digital products on Shopify is painful (e.g. generating and distributing license keys).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Automate the generation and distribution of license keys with SaaS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attractiveness</strong>: 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This is quite a specific problem that we only encountered once. But it is a beautiful problem: the person having it gave a clear account as to why this problem is so painful. They already established a crappy workaround by manually generating batches of license keys and sending them via email. They are also actively looking for a solution and shared more problems they&#39;d love to have solved.</p>\n\n<p>These are great signs that this could be a good opportunity: a person shouting about their problems, building workarounds, and looking for better solutions. That&#39;s the type of problem one could dream of. It seems like the solution to this problem can be automated, so SaaS should be the way to go.</p>\n\n<h1>📊 Market Analysis of Shopify Stores</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Shopify entrepreneurs are looking for winning products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Scrape and analyze Shopify store data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Attractiveness</strong>: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 We found someone who is already doing this and the idea was well-perceived, people wanted it. But the execution could have been better. Some people were unhappy with the quality of the data and how it was analyzed. That&#39;s the challenge here: building a better web-scraper &amp; do better analysis. But it should be feasible.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/qmlw2e/ideas_for_side_projects_in_the_shopify_ecosystem/","title":"Ideas for side projects in the Shopify ecosystem","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"November 04, 2021","dateISO":"2021-11-04T19:03:21.000Z","datetime":"2021-11-04 19:03","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"qmlw2e","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/qmlw2e/ideas_for_side_projects_in_the_shopify_ecosystem/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/qmlw2e/ideas_for_side_projects_in_the_shopify_ecosystem/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"yogicmeditations","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/yogicmeditations","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"yogicmeditations","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"Shopifyのエコシステムにおけるサイドプロジェクトのアイデア","the_new_excerpt":"皆さん、こんにちは。\n\nShopifyのエコシステムについて調べてみました。\n[https://www.communityvalidated.co/p/-shopify-entrepreneurs-community]をご覧ください。I\n20万人以上のメンバーがいるShopifyの起業家のオンラインコミュニティを研究し、100以上の問題を特定しました。\n100以上の問題を特定しました。以下に、私が考えた4つの潜在的なサイドプロジェクトのリストを紹介します。\nプロジェクトを紹介します。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"在Shopify生态系统中开展副业的想法","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我在Shopify的生态系统中做了一些研究\n[https://www.communityvalidated.co/p/-shopify-entrepreneurs-community]。I\n研究了拥有超过200.000名成员的Shopify企业家的在线社区，并发现了超过100个问题。\n发现了>100个问题。下面，我将分享一个精心策划的4个潜在的副业清单。\n项目。","locale":"zh"},{"title":"在Shopify生態系統中開展副業的想法","the_new_excerpt":"大家好。\n\n我在Shopify的生態系統中做了一些研究\n[https://www.communityvalidated.co/p/-shopify-entrepreneurs-community]。I\n研究了擁有超過200.000名成員的Shopify企業家的在線社區，並發現了超過100個問題。\n發現了>100個問題。下面，我將分享一個精心策劃的4個潛在的副業清單。\n項目。","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-qmjox3","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/qmjox3/this_time_i_used_my_no_code_tool_to_create_a/","title":"This time I used my no code tool to create a paint program.","date":"November 04, 2021","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今回は、ノーコードツールを使って、ペイントプログラムを作ってみました。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"这次我用我的无码工具创建了一个绘画程序。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"這次我用我的無碼工具創建了一個繪畫程序。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-qmu9b5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/qmu9b5/ive_gotten_back_to_making_these_thinking_of/","title":"I've gotten back to making these.
