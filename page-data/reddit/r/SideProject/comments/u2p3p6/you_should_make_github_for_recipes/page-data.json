People add their own twists and find small improvements. So where is version control for recipes?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Today&amp;#39;s Idea: The Spark Notes Version&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves recipes. But there are 10s of millions on the internet. No one is able to verify which are best and you can&amp;#39;t save your own changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is Github for recipes. Search for the right recipes, and find the most referenced / contributed to. If you find a way to improve it, you can fork your own branch, or request to change the original. You can see all the past variations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a company working on a food product, you can keep all of your recipes in one repository. You can see all the past versions, and keep track of changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Long Version&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recipes are some of the most shared things on the internet. Whenever any of us want to cook something new, we Google for the best recipes. Some of us have favorite chefs or influencers who we go to for their concoctions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the thing is, recipes really don&amp;#39;t have a great internet infrastructure. They&amp;#39;re all overly optimized for SEO. It&amp;#39;s a cliché at this point to mention it, but no one wants to read your life story to finally get to your recipe for banana bread. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There also isn&amp;#39;t a great way to find recipes, evaluate their quality, or get a sense of the community reaction to the recipe. Of course you can try to parse blog comments, but good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This idea fundamentally changes the way that recipes work on the internet, for the better. Let&amp;#39;s first go over what it is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea is Github for recipes. If you don&amp;#39;t know what Github is, it&amp;#39;s a website where programmers can upload their code. Any time they make any changes, it is saved as a version. Anyone can go back and see every previous version. This means you don&amp;#39;t lose your work, and if you make a mistake you can always revert to a previous version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Github also provides what are called repositories. These are folders where a programmer can upload a whole bunch of different pieces of code, to organize them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, Github is built for community collaboration. Anyone can take a piece of code in a Github library, and either fork it (where they create their own copy and can make changes), or create a pull request (where their changes are adopted into the main code).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would implement each of these features into recipes. Companies who make food products would be able to keep their recipes in one central repository. Their chefs would be able to update them and see all previous versions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Communities could collaborate on the best chocolate chip cookie recipe. Anyone can then fork the recipe and make their own changes. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There would be a robust search where people could find the best recipe for a given food product, based on number of contributors, age, upvotes, etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This product would fundamentally change the way we cook. I hope you make it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/u2p3p6/you_should_make_github_for_recipes/","title":"You Should Make Github for Recipes","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"April 13, 2022","dateISO":"2022-04-13T13:37:11.000Z","datetime":"2022-04-13 13:37","image":null,"imageAlt":null,"socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"u2p3p6","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/u2p3p6/you_should_make_github_for_recipes/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/u2p3p6/you_should_make_github_for_recipes/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"dailyidea","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/dailyidea","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"dailyidea","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"レシピのためにGithubを作るべき","the_new_excerpt":"レシピは時間とともに進化し、変化します。人々は自分なりの工夫を加え、小さな発見をします。\n改良を加えています。では、レシピのバージョン管理はどこにあるのでしょうか？\n\n\n今日のアイデア スパークノート編\n\n誰もが大好きなレシピ。しかし、インターネット上には何千万というレシピが存在します。誰も\nどれがベストなのか、検証することができます。","locale":"ja"},{"title":"你应该为食谱做Github","the_new_excerpt":"食谱随着时间的推移不断发展和变化。人们添加他们自己的扭曲，并发现小\n改进。那么，菜谱的版本控制在哪里呢？\n\n\n今天的想法。火花笔记版本\n\n每个人都喜欢菜谱。但互联网上有几千万个。没有人\n能验证哪些是最好的，而你...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"你應該爲食譜做Github","the_new_excerpt":"食譜隨着時間的推移不斷髮展和變化。人們添加他們自己的扭曲，並發現小\n改進。那麼，菜譜的版本控制在哪裏呢？\n\n\n今天的想法。火花筆記版本\n\n每個人都喜歡菜譜。但互聯網上有幾千萬個。沒有人\n能驗證哪些是最好的，而你...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-u2pd71","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/u2pd71/i_spent_1200_hours_this_year_building_a_simulator/","title":"I spent 1200 hours this year building a simulator for personal finance 📈😃☕","date":"April 13, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"今年は1200時間かけてパーソナルファイナンスのシミュレーターを作りました📈😃☕。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"今年は1200時間かけてパーソナルファイナンスのシミュレーターを作りました📈😃☕。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"},{"title":"我今年花了1200个小时建立一个个人财务的模拟器📈😃☕。","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-reddit-placeholder-1","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/dankmemes/comments/kc0vb6/i_tried_my_best/","title":"I tried my best","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","date":"January 01, 1970","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"我尽力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh"},{"title":"我盡力了","the_new_excerpt":"test","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}}},"pageContext":{"basePath":"/","pageType":"detail","id":"RedditPost-u2p3p6","previousId":"RedditPost-u2pd71","maxWidth":1024,"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://sideproject.buzzing.cc","author":"Buzzing.cc","locale":"zh","title":"业余项目分享交流","shortTitle":"业余项目","description":"用中文浏览reddit业余项目讨论","keywords":["buzzing","业余项目","程序员"],"telegram":"@buzzingcc","telegram_chat_id":"-1001406368978","iconUrl":"https://sideproject.buzzing.cc/avatar.png","menuLinks":[],"subscriptions":[{"name":"Twitter @buzzingcc","url":"https://twitter.com/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"Telegram @buzzingcc","url":"https://t.me/buzzingcc","external":true},{"name":"RSS","url":"/rss.xml","prefetch":false}],"social":[{"name":"SideProject","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/","external":true},{"name":"Buzzing","url":"https://www.buzzing.cc/","external":true}],"localize":[{"locale":"en","title":"Buzzing on Side Project","shortTitle":"BuzzNews","description":"See what's buzzing on Side Project in your native language","keywords":["buzzing","Side Project"],"menuLinks":[]},{"locale":"zh-Hant","title":"業餘項目分享交流","shortTitle":"業餘項目","description":"用中文瀏覽reddit業餘項目討論","keywords":["buzzing","業餘項目","程序員"],"menuLinks":[]},{"locale":"ja","title":"サイドプロジェクト","shortTitle":"サイドプロジェクト","description":"人気のサイドプロジェクトを日本語で閲覧","keywords":["buzzing","サイドプロジェクト"],"menuLinks":[]}],"defaultSocialImageUrl":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1624129591276-5b11185e7b42?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2739&q=80"},"locale":"zh","hrefLang":"zh-Hans","originalPath":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/u2p3p6/you_should_make_github_for_recipes/","dateFormat":"YYYY-MM-DD"}},
