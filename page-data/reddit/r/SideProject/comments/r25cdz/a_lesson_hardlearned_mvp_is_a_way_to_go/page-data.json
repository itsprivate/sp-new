Nevertheless, I was always working on &quot;great ideas&quot; that came to my mind without validating them... yes, I know. it&#39;s a so classic mistake...</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I came up with a decision: I will not start any &quot;great idea&quot; without validating it. Instead of starting to invest hundreds of hours into building it, I&#39;ve decided to validate first. That was nothing new for me, but somehow I was very good at ignoring &quot;theory&quot; and felt that &quot;I know that it will work this time, no validation is needed&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>I did some research this time. My target was to find a niche that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is a clear problem that I will solve</li>\n<li>Niche has the potential to grow in the next years</li>\n<li>There are more than 1M potential customers</li>\n<li>I&#39;m able to implement it without learning any new stuff - it should be a web-based solution because I&#39;m a web/full stack developer</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After several months of research, I found it. Podcasts are a really big thing and still blowing. A website is a must-have for every podcast. Most podcasters have a website, but - it takes too much time to maintain it, platforms like WordPress, Wix, Squarespace are fit for everything and at the same time for nothing, because these platforms are so complicated/flexible. There is definitely a problem I could try to solve!</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve reached to multiple podcast hosts asking if they are happy with their current (or not existing at all) website. Collected feedback into Excel - and was more than motivated - 83% of responses were positive looking from my perspective.</p>\n\n<p>I launched MVP - it was really a MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT with core features - website builder for podcasters. Reached $1000MRR, earned over $10k in the last year, reInvested that money, and <strong>reLaunched rebranded/fully featured platform according to early customers feedback</strong> a few weeks ago - <a href=\"https://onpodium.com\">https://onpodium.com</a>!</p>\n\n<p>The main purpose of my post is to say that everybody knows so far, but probably sometimes ignores it (just like I did for so many years). <strong>It doesn&#39;t make sense to start investing your time in building something if you didn&#39;t do at least minimal validation with your potential customers if it will work.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes, I know, this is nothing new. I&#39;ve read this many times before, but somehow ignored it, burned more than 6 years building things that nobody needs, and of course, none of them are running today.</p>\n\n<p>If this post will trigger at least one of you to think again that validation and MVP are the key points - then I think It made sense to post it here :)</p>\n\n<p>Good luck with your side projects!</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/r25cdz/a_lesson_hardlearned_mvp_is_a_way_to_go/","title":"A lesson hard-learned...
