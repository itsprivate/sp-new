You know... to know how the successful guys cracked the code, created amazing things, and achieved some lvl of success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I wanted to share a few of these. I also wrote more in-depth articles, with more strategies and psychology explained behind them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;OnlyFans&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make use of your previous experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Timothy Stokely, the founder, previously had similar startups, like GlamGirls, GlamWorship, and Customs4U.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were basically porn sites. They gave Stokely an experience (and networks) in the world of content for adults. The first creators on OnlyFans.com came from that source. Stokely reached out to porn influencers and encouraged them to move to OnlyFans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter integration from day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans accounts had automatic Twitter integration. Creators could share their referral links easily on Twitter. Their fans could see it immediately. It worked seamlessly since day 1 of OnlyFans and generated a great boost to the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loose censorship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OnlyFans got so popular thanks to its loose censorship policy. Porn stars were able to share their content that would get quickly banned in most of the other places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-onlyfans-grew-to-over-100-million-users/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Canva&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MVP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melanie Perkins was teaching students about design. She noticed that students had a huge need for a simple graphic design tool. She wanted to make it easier to create visuals.  Photoshop was too intimidating for most users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she created &amp;quot;Fusion Books&amp;quot; which would enable schools to design and create high-quality yearbooks for students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perkins and Obrecht made some cold calls to schools to pitch the idea of Fusion Books. Obrecht modulated his voice when the schools wanted to speak with the project manager. They have reached 400 schools. They even sent some free samples of the designs and it worked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spreading the word through conferences and people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To promote Canva, Perkins kept going to as many conferences and meet-ups as possible. She attended conferences for bloggers, designers, and social media marketers. She pitched Canva to the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perkins and Obrecht reached out to popular designers and graphic design influencers. They asked them to talk about Canva and recommend it to their followers and fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a waitlist with the help of a high-profile tech influencer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perkins and Obrecht built a community around Canva and created a waitlist. It was all before Canva even started.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;50,000 users have signed up on their waitlist before Canva&amp;#39;s public launch. It got to 150,000 pretty fast thanks to a tech influencer, Guy Kawasaki. One of Kawasaki’s employees was using Canva and made him get interested in the app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-canva-grew-to-1-million-users-in-2-years-canva-marketing-strategies/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reddit&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faking traffic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reddit founders had a “chicken &amp;amp; egg” problem. No users to create a content = no users to see the content.The founders created several fake accounts and started posting various links. They kept doing this for months until they got some real traction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the first real users started joining Reddit, fake accounts started to disappear. People reported their “odd activity” and the fake accounts got phased out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making it look bigger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, Reddit’s creators put all users in one place to create a “feeling” that the platform is “crowded”. One group with 100 users looks much better than a group with 10 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users generated content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 years after the launch, Reddit users could submit their own subreddits. This feature gave steady growth at the beginning&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-reddit-started-and-grew-to-250m-monthly-pageviews-within-5-years/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Pinterest&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word of mouth and first users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first Pinterest users were from the creator’s hometown, Des Moines. Ben, the founder was organizing meet-ups at local boutiques and handed out invites to the attendees. The word spread further within smaller groups and clubs. The First 3,000 users appeared within 3 months. Most of these people were involved in some DIY and handicraft stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invite-only &amp;amp;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;„Pin it forward” campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The first 2 years Pinterest was an invite-only platform.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ben has partnered with SF Girl by Bay, an SF-based blogger, to create an inspirational pinboard on „what home means to you”.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Then, other bloggers, mostly publishing about DIY or handicraft, were invited to the platform and to participate in the campaign, sharing their take on the subjects through sharing their pinboard with their readers. And those bloggers had invites to give away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That campaign gathered 300 bloggers and 10 of them published each week on a topic and linked back to pinboard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;That was simply marketing Pinterest through community leaders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-did-pinterest-start-and-grew-to-40-million-valuation-in-the-first-year/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Slack&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word of mouth with Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Slack’s founder, Stewart Butterfield, also created Flickr. He was widely known by various communities. His Twitter accounts had thousands of followers. He tweeted a lot about Slack. The word spread pretty fast among people. 8,000 users signed up on Slack&amp;#39;s day one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on good PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Butterfield reached out directly to the journalists. His team informed them about a new project “from the author of Flickr.” It gave Slack a boost - about 20% of Slack’s user growth was because of media.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-slack-got-from-0-to-1-12-b-and-285k-users-in-the-first-year-marketing-strategies-and-psychology/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;HEY (email)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal brand and Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before HEY email Jason Fried and David Heinemeier, founded the Basecamp. They both had hundreds of thousands of followers on their Twitter accounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They tweeted about the app before they launched it, and kept gradually letting people onto their waitlist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waitlist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fried and David used it to pump up the hype around Hey email. One week after the app&amp;#39;s launch, they already got more than 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://kickstartsidehustle.com/how-hey-email-got-100k-users-in-the-first-week/\"&gt;Link to the article with more details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First users among friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jan Koum, WhatsApp’s founder, attended weekly meetings at his friend’s place. There were a lot of local Russians, and Koum pitched WhatsApp to them. It gave him the first dozens of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abusing App Store loopholes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;App Store didn&amp;#39;t have many apps at that time. Koum discovered that the “What&amp;#39;s New” section could be easily abused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By constantly changing the name of WhatsApp on App Store it kept the app at the top of the App Store&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s New&amp;quot; list. This little cheat made WhatsApp stay there for as long as the loop didn’t get fixed by Apple. It was enough to collect the first 1,000 users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Snapchat&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitching the app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, the founders of Snapchat, pitched their app (called then “Picaboo”) in their community:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;they handed out flyers,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;they were giving tutorials,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;they were talking to people 1-on-1 about the app,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;and even reached out to some journalists.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn’t get them much popularity, though. They got only 127 users, and all of them were their friends.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available for iPads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Snapchat started to grow when Spiegel and Murphy made it available for iPads. The target audience was teenagers and students. But, not many of them had iPhones at that time. iPads were more common.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Murphy took a job as a coder in a company selling iPads and learned their system. So, he thought Snapchat should be available not only for iPhones but also for iPads. That slowly took the user count to 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapping into high schoolers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Snapchat got 127 users in the first 6 months - mostly founders&amp;#39; friends&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When after 6 months one of the founders’ mother told their teenage cousin about the snapchat, the app went instantly viral at a local high school in Southern California, and beyond.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It gave teenagers an opportunity to exchange messages quickly and left no evidence.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The app grew from 127 to 30k in 2 months&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thant&amp;#39;s all, thanks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/tpfdhv/how_onlyfans_canva_snapchat_pinterest_and_others/","title":"How OnlyFans, Canva, Snapchat, Pinterest, and others got their first users...","tags":["SideProject","reddit"],"date":"March 27, 2022","dateISO":"2022-03-27T08:46:00.000Z","datetime":"2022-03-27 08:46","image":null,"imageAlt":"Reddit Image","socialImage":null,"__typename":"SocialMediaPost","thirdPartyId":"tpfdhv","provider":"Reddit","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/tpfdhv/how_onlyfans_canva_snapchat_pinterest_and_others/","originalUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/tpfdhv/how_onlyfans_canva_snapchat_pinterest_and_others/","imageRemote":null,"video":null,"channel":"SideProject","channelUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject","author":"Limejhit","authorUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/user/Limejhit","authorImage":null,"authorImageRemote":null,"authorSlug":"Limejhit","score":5,"views":null,"sharedCount":null,"likeCount":null,"sharedContent":null,"parent":{"localize":[{"title":"OnlyFans、Canva、Snapchat、Pinterestなどが最初のユーザーを獲得した方法...","the_new_excerpt":"というケーススタディ（というかフレームワーク）に魅了されてきました。\n成功したビジネスは、その旅立ちから始まります。その...成功者がどのように\n成功者は、コードを解読し、素晴らしいものを作り、あるレベルを達成した。\n成功の\n\n今日はそのうちのいくつかを紹介したいと思います。また、他にも書いています...","locale":"ja"},{"title":"OnlyFans、Canva、Snapchat、Pinterest和其他公司如何获得他们的第一批用户。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直对成功企业如何开始他们的旅程的案例研究（或更像框架）很着迷。\n成功的企业如何开始他们的旅程。你知道......要知道那些成功人士是如何\n成功的人是如何破解密码，创造出惊人的东西，并取得某种程度的\n的成功。\n\n今天，我想分享其中的几个案例。我还写了更多...","locale":"zh"},{"title":"OnlyFans、Canva、Snapchat、Pinterest和其他公司如何獲得他們的第一批用戶。","the_new_excerpt":"我一直對成功企業如何開始他們的旅程的案例研究（或更像框架）很着迷。\n成功的企業如何開始他們的旅程。你知道......要知道那些成功人士是如何\n成功的人是如何破解密碼，創造出驚人的東西，並取得某種程度的\n的成功。\n\n今天，我想分享其中的幾個案例。我還寫了更多...","locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"previous":{"id":"RedditPost-tpbsg5","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/tpbsg5/ive_made_an_app_to_make_beautiful_images_and_gifs/","title":"I've made an App to make beautiful Images and GIFs of code","date":"March 27, 2022","__typename":"SocialMediaPost","provider":"Reddit","parent":{"localize":[{"title":"コードの美しい画像やGIFを作るアプリを作りました","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"ja"},{"title":"我做了一个应用程序，可以制作漂亮的图片和GIF的代码","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh"},{"title":"我做了一個應用程序，可以製作漂亮的圖片和GIF的代碼","the_new_excerpt":null,"locale":"zh-Hant"}]}},"next":{"id":"RedditPost-tpt71u","excerpt":"","slug":"/reddit/r/SideProject/comments/tpt71u/what_happens_if_we_use_okcupids_algorithm_to_see/","title":"What happens if we use OkCupid's algorithm to see how you match with a job position?
